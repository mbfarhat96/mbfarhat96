## About Me

I'm a dedicated Technical Analyst and Software Engineer with a passion for solving complex problems and building innovative solutions. With a strong background in both analysis and development.\
I thrive at the intersection of technology and business, creating new things and exploring new tech is a passion of mine.
Uncomfortable situations breed the most growth, so you'll likely find projects here that look like a mess, but I promise there's insight in the chaos you might come across.
